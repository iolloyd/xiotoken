# Security Model

## Overview

The XIO Token Implementation employs a comprehensive security model focusing on:
- Smart contract security
- Access control
- Emergency response
- Operational security

## Smart Contract Security

### Access Control

#### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE
- PAUSER_ROLE
- MINTER_ROLE

#### Multi-Signature Requirements
- Treasury operations
- Critical parameter changes
- Emergency functions

### Contract Security Features

#### Pausable Operations
- Token transfers
- Token swaps
- Administrative functions

#### Time Locks
- Function-level time locks
- Administrative action delays
- Upgrade time locks

#### Rate Limiting
- Transaction size limits
- Time-based restrictions
- Withdrawal limits

### Security Mechanisms

#### Reentrancy Protection
- ReentrancyGuard implementation
- Check-Effects-Interactions pattern
- State management best practices

#### Integer Overflow Protection
- SafeMath implementation
- Solidity ^0.8.0 built-in overflow checks
- Additional validation layers

## Emergency Procedures

### Emergency Response Plan

1. **Detection**
   - Automated monitoring
   - Community reporting
   - Internal discovery

2. **Assessment**
   - Impact evaluation
   - Risk classification
   - Response determination

3. **Response**
   - Contract pausing
   - Emergency fixes
   - Communication

4. **Recovery**
   - Fix implementation
   - Validation
   - Resumption of operations

### Emergency Contacts

[To be added: Emergency contact information]

## Operational Security

### Key Management

1. **Multi-Signature Wallets**
   - N-of-M signature requirement
   - Hardware wallet integration
   - Distributed key holders

2. **Key Rotation**
   - Regular key rotation schedule
   - Compromise response procedure
   - Backup key management

### Deployment Security

1. **Deployment Process**
   - Multi-step verification
   - Test environment validation
   - Production checklist

2. **Contract Verification**
   - Source code verification
   - Bytecode verification
   - External audit validation

## Audit History

[To be added: Audit reports and findings]

## Bug Bounty Program

### Scope

- Smart Contracts
- Access Control
- Token Economics
- Integration Points

### Rewards

[To be added: Reward structure]

### Submission Process

[To be added: Submission guidelines]
