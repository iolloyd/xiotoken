# Security Documentation

## Security Model

### Core Security Features

1. **Rate Limiting**
   - Transfer limits per time period
   - Configurable parameters
   - Exemption list for trusted addresses
   - Protection against market manipulation

2. **Role-Based Access Control**
   ```solidity
   PAUSER_ROLE
   MINTER_ROLE
   BURNER_ROLE
   OPERATOR_ROLE
   GOVERNANCE_ROLE
   ```

3. **Emergency Controls**
   - Emergency mode activation
   - Time-delayed actions
   - Recovery address system
   - Multi-signature requirements

4. **Governance Timelock**
   - Execution delay (2 days)
   - Execution window (5 days)
   - Proposal thresholds

## Attack Vectors & Mitigations

### 1. Flash Loan Attacks
**Vector:** Large token acquisitions for governance manipulation
**Mitigations:**
- Rate limiting on transfers
- Governance snapshots
- Minimum holding periods

### 2. Governance Attacks
**Vector:** Malicious proposals or emergency actions
**Mitigations:**
- Multi-signature requirements
- Timelock delays
- Quorum requirements
- Emergency system override

### 3. Front-Running
**Vector:** MEV exploitation of token transfers or burns
**Mitigations:**
- Rate limiting
- Burn mechanics design
- Private transaction pools for critical operations

### 4. Smart Contract Vulnerabilities
**Vector:** Code exploitation
**Mitigations:**
- Comprehensive test suite
- External audits
- Formal verification
- Bug bounty program

## Security Procedures

### Emergency Response

1. **Detect**
   - Monitoring system alerts
   - Community reports
   - Automated checks

2. **Assess**
   ```
   Severity Levels:
   CRITICAL - Immediate action required
   HIGH     - Response within 1 hour
   MEDIUM   - Response within 24 hours
   LOW      - Monitor and plan
   ```

3. **Respond**
   - Activate emergency mode if needed
   - Execute emergency actions
   - Communicate with stakeholders

4. **Recover**
   - Implement fixes
   - Verify system state
   - Resume normal operations

### Role Management

1. **Role Assignment**
   ```solidity
   function grantRole(bytes32 role, address account)
   function revokeRole(bytes32 role, address account)
   ```

2. **Access Control Matrix**
   ```
   Function               | Admin | Operator | Governance
   ----------------------|-------|----------|------------
   updateRateLimit       |   ✓   |    ✓    |     
   executeQuarterlyBurn  |   ✓   |         |    ✓
   initiateEmergencyMode |   ✓   |         |    
   executeProposal       |       |         |    ✓
   ```

3. **Key Rotation Procedures**
   - Quarterly review of role assignments
   - Emergency key rotation process
   - Multi-signature requirements

## Monitoring & Alerts

### System Monitoring

1. **On-Chain Monitoring**
   ```javascript
   // Event monitoring
   contract.on("Transfer", (from, to, amount) => {
     checkThresholds(amount);
   });

   // Rate limit monitoring
   async function checkRateLimits() {
     const status = await contract.getRateLimitStatus();
     alertIfClose(status);
   }
   ```

2. **Off-Chain Monitoring**
   - API endpoint health
   - Block reorganization detection
   - Gas price monitoring

### Alert Thresholds

1. **Transfer Monitoring**
   ```
   ALERT_THRESHOLD = 100,000 tokens
   CRITICAL_THRESHOLD = 500,000 tokens
   ```

2. **Rate Limit Alerts**
   ```
   WARN_AT = 80% of limit
   ALERT_AT = 90% of limit
   ```

3. **Burn Monitoring**
   ```
   MAX_SINGLE_BURN = 5% of supply
   QUARTERLY_BURN_ALERT = 15% of max burn
   ```

## Audit Requirements

### Smart Contract Audits

1. **Scope**
   - All smart contracts
   - Deployment scripts
   - Access control system
   - Integration points

2. **Focus Areas**
   ```
   - Rate limiting logic
   - Burn mechanics
   - Governance system
   - Emergency controls
   - Role management
   ```

3. **Verification Methods**
   - Manual code review
   - Automated analysis
   - Formal verification
   - Penetration testing

### Security Tools

1. **Static Analysis**
   ```bash
   # Slither
   slither .

   # Mythril
   myth analyze contracts/*.sol
   ```

2. **Dynamic Analysis**
   ```bash
   # Echidna
   echidna-test contracts/XIO.sol

   # Coverage
   make coverage
   ```
